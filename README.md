# Challenge: Scenario

Year by year, disaster and crisis strike societies all over the world, leaving people and communities without resources. These include natural disasters such as tornados, earthquakes and hurricanes. Or human made such as shootings, terrorist attacks and chemical spills. The problematic tackled in this challenge is to create a solution focused on helping survivors in an aftermath of a hurricane, this would be really useful and a project that could save lives in tropical countries such as Brazil and Mexico, where flooding related experiences and it's estimated that in the future will augment thanks to events such as global warming, as seen in this following map:.

The proposed solutioon consists on a provider where is possible to send a help message to restue teams where the risk, location and severity are processed, sending drones which could function as communication or supply resources. The motivation behind this is to create a modern solution to a constant and recurring problematic using the Computing Tecnologies concepts seen in our respective classes  //Cambiar


# Challenge: Global Classroom Methodology and Challenge procedure //Cambiar

This challenge follows the methodology of a Global Shared Classroom, which consists of 5 weeks of collaborative work (sectioned in ice breaker, working sesions and reflections) between two different universities from different countries, in this case being Tecnologíco de Monterry from Mexico and Instituto Tecnologíco de Aeronautica from Brazil.

In this case our team consisting of students from Mexico and Brazil, will be solving the Reto based on the concepts seen in our respective classes, including:

- Database creation and management
- Logic Gates and Chips
- Internet of Things
- Business plans
- Networking   

And we will make a tangible and executable solution using software such as: 

- Mosquitto
- Python
- Microsoft Azure
- Linux/Ubuntu virtual machines 
- PHP
- SQL
