# Challenge: Scenario and Motivation

Year by year, disaster and crisis strike societies all over the world, leaving people and communities without resources. These include natural disasters such as tornados, earthquakes and hurricanes. Or human made such as shootings, terrorist attacks and chemical spills. Basing the poblematic scenario on a flooding aftermath, being the one of the most common in tropical countries such as Mexico and Brazil where there's now way to communicate and get resources thanks to the blackouts caused by the disaster.

The proposed solutioon consists on a provider where is possible to send a help message to restue teams where the risk, location and severity are processed, sending drones which could function as communication or supply resources. The motivation behind this is to create a modern solution to a constant and recurring problematic using the Computing Tecnologies concepts seen in our respective classes 


# Challenge: Methodology and Concepts

This challenge follows the methodology of a Global Shared Classroom, which consists of 5 weeks of collaborative work (sectioned in ice breaker, working sesions and reflections) between two different universities from different countries, in this case being Tecnologíco de Monterry from Mexico and Instituto Tecnologíco de Aeronautica from Brazil.

In this case our team consisting of students from Mexico and Brazil, will be solving the Reto based on the concepts seen in our respective classes, including:

- Database creation and management
- Logic Gates and Chips
- Internet of Things
- Business plans
- Networking

And we will make a tangible and executable solution using software such as: 

- Mosquitto
- Python
- Microsoft Azure
- Linux/Ubuntu virtual machines 
- PHP
- SQL
